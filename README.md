# FE3 text

Decompiles dialogue scripts from Fire Emblem 3.

## Usage

```console
$ fe3-text <file> -o <offset>
```
*offset* can be omitted if it's zero.

## TODO

- Not all kanjis have been mapped, so most will show up as as a full stop.
- Understand the unknown commands.
- Move the mapping into a config file.
